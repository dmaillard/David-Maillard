## Digital Marketing for Real World Business Results

What would it mean for your business if, instead of getting 2 leads a day, you got 5?

### You donâ€™t want to be an expert â€” you just want results!

But with so much confusion online, rapid-fire changes in the industry, so many channels to choose from, and so many digital marketing â€˜expertsâ€™ dishing advice for your website and more, itâ€™s hard to know what direction to take.

Small business owners are frustrated by the exact same marketing problems today:

## We really need more salesâ€¦ BUT

*   Your traditional methods of advertising just arenâ€™t working like they used to
*   You tried Adwords before and the clicks were too expensive
*   With all the Google updates, youâ€™re not really sure what to do to rank
*   Youâ€™re anxious about how to keep up in such a fast-paced landscape
*   With all the conflicting advice out there â€” who do you believe?

## We make digital marketing profitable for your business.

A â€˜one size fits allâ€™ approach no longer works in online marketing. What works well for your accountant may not work at all for your business. Thatâ€™s why most online advertising and Search Engine Optimisation companies deliver measly results at best, often leaving owners out of pocket.

People are scared theyâ€™re going to be left behind or worse still, made redundant. Your strategy needs to keep up with the incredible acceleration of change thatâ€™s happening all around us.

Consider us as your own marketing team, with you for the long haul. With each new Google update, new SEO tactics to take advantage of and every other game-changing strategy thatâ€™s developed â€“ you can rely on us to keep you in the loop.

## Get more ideal leads with smart search marketing

The goal for any business today is to be in front of people right when theyâ€™re searching for what it is you sell.

The process of getting in front of your audience when theyâ€™re searching online however is not so straight-forward. Itâ€™s called search engine optimisation (SEO) but be aware, old school SEO tactics are dead.

What worked a year ago no longer works today.

Together, weâ€™ll develop a strong digital footprint for you brand and send all the right signals to Google that youâ€™re the real dealâ€¦ so you show up when and where you should in search engines.

But we wonâ€™t just help drive traffic, weâ€™ll ensure that the pages we send them to are optimised to convert them into customers. Because traffic is good â€” but customers are better.

## Instant customers with just one click

Youâ€™ve probably heard the term â€˜PPC advertisingâ€™ thrown around before (which stands for Pay-Per-Click), but have you experienced what it can do for your business yet? You may have experienced Adwords text or display Ads or even Social Advertising on the likes of Facebook. A solid Pay-Per-Click campaign done well can turn your businessâ€™ marketing on its head â€” almost instantly.

We believe every business should have an online advertising strategy. But there is a difference between setting up any old PPC campaign and one that works in conjunction with all your other marketing efforts. The keys are strategy, planning, review, refinement, optimisation and monitoring that we provide with every campaign â€” to ensure we continuously drive targeted customers to your online business to achieve a specific goal.

Using Google, Bing, Yahoo and Facebookâ€™s advertising platforms, we can ensure we deliver the right message to your intended audience, at the right time. And if you ever feel like youâ€™re being chased around the web after visiting a website, you are. Itâ€™s called â€˜retargetingâ€™. We do that too but in a non-creepy way. ðŸ˜‰

## Increase your exposure with social media marketing

The importance of social media as part of your online marketing strategy canâ€™t be overstated. More than a quarter of the world's population is on Facebook so if your business isnâ€™t part of the conversation, youâ€™re leaving profits on the table for your competitors to swoop in and take.

To create an organic marketing plan that works hard to achieve your goals, itâ€™s important that your search engine optimisation, online advertising and social media efforts all fit into the one strategy.

We can help you harness social media to become an authority in your industry, engage with your audience, promote your content and grow your market share.
